# Contribute

    **In this project, I refactored the website helping to make easier understanding html content. with in the html index, I edited and included semantics where neccessary. Following after, I concised the CSS folder to better read.**

# Conclusion

    **I found this to be troubling at first. After much practice, and reading, I was able to understand more. I found the html structure like writing a paper. The layout is similar in my eyes. SO I was able to relate, and assess a lot clearer.
