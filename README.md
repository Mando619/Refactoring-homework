    It's purpose is to find customers that are in search for the
    right business for any situation.


## Description

    In this project, I refactored the website helping to make easier
    understanding html content. with in the html index, I edited 
    and included semantics where neccessary. Descriptions of the images,
    using alt element, helps describe in text. Helping those with
    disabilities or browser not loading the image. Following after,
     I concised the CSS folder to better read.

## Installation

    No installation is required for this.

## Conclusion

    I found this to be troubling at first. After much practice, and
    reading, I was able to understand more. I found the html
    structure like writing a paper. The layout is similar in my eyes.
    I was able to relate, and assess, a lot clearer.
